### The Game Play

The objective of this game is to train your concentrating skill.

1. Player has to remember a sequence of colours before starting the game.
2. Once game starts, there will be a countdown timer depending on the difficulty of the game level.
3. Player has to follow the lines according to the sequence they remembered.
4. Once going through the line, press the corresponding button to lock your input.
5. Once all the button are pressed, the game will check if your input is the same as the pattern set by the game.
6. If true, process to the next level.
7. If false, retry the current level with a different sequence set by the game.
8. Player will play through 25 levels.
9. Once completed, game will restart to default page and restart at level 1.

### Functions

restart()
* when game finish, the restart button will be fired.
* reset variables and set back to game default.


randomInPlay()
* main for playing.
* get game timing, random number, get a random combination, set the sequence base on the combination and update the triangle image base on the combination, update the modal.


checkForWin(inPlay, player) {
* check to see if they are all matching and also clear the set interval.
* base on condition return true or false.

---

### Event Listeners

$('.btn-new-game').on('click', function() {});
* click new game button - image change, random sequence, show modal, remove new game button, show timer, show level and sequence to play.


$('.lets-go-btn').on('click', function() {});

### Code Discussion

##### Global Variables

```
var minutes, seconds, sequenceInPlay, playerSequence, interval, timer;
var level = 1;
var gameSource = {
  images: {
    red: 'images/project1-triangle-red.png',
    green: 'images/project1-triangle-green.png',
    blue: 'images/project1-triangle-blue.png'
  },
  seqCombination: [
    ['red', 'green', 'blue'],
    ['red', 'blue', 'green'],
    ['green', 'red', 'blue'],
    ['green', 'blue', 'red'],
    ['blue', 'red', 'green'],
    ['blue', 'green', 'red'],
  ],
  level1: {
    red: 1,
    green: 2,
    blue: 3,
    timing: 10
  },
  level2: {
    red: 1,
    green: 2,
    blue: 3,
    timing: 10
    .
    .
  }
```

This object contains the images that will correspond with the sequence of the colour combination.

```
random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
combination = gameSource.seqCombination[random];
sequence = gameSource['level' + level];

// i will be red, blue or green
for (var i of combination) {
  sequenceInPlay.push(sequence[i]);
}

for (var i of combination) {
  src = gameSource.images[i];
  triangleImg += `<img class="triangle" src="${src}">`;
}

// place on the modal to show the sequence of the triangle
$('.triangle-seq').append(triangleImg);
```

* combination will get a random array of the red, blue, green combination from object seqCombination.
* first loop will get the number for comparison with the player array.
* second loop will get the images link to be append to modal box the show player what is the sequence.

### Add On Game

# UnderLimit

### The Game Play

The objective of the game is to collect the colours in sequence within the time limit.

1. Player has to remember a sequence of colours before starting the game.
2. Once game starts, there will be a countdown timer depending on the difficulty of the game level.
3. Player has use the keyboard arrow button the navigate the maze.
4. Collecting the colours in sequence.
5. Once all the colours are collected, the game will check if your input is the same as the pattern set by the game.
6. If true, process to the next level.
7. If false, retry the current level with a different sequence set by the game.
8. Player will play through 15 levels.
9. Once completed, game will restart to default page and restart at level 1.

// ============== on click buttons ==================













Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** â€“ since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!


---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Any number of players** will be okay, switch turns will be great
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**, jQuery is not compulsory
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* **No canvas** project will be accepted, only HTML5 + CSS3 + JS please

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what youâ€™ll be getting into.
* **Donâ€™t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if youâ€™re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you havenâ€™t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Self-scoring Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
